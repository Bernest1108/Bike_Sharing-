# Bike_Sharing
## Overview
While on vacation in New York City using the Citi Bike network to move around the city, the idea came to us to bring a similar business venture to Des Moines, Iowa. Because Citi Bike makes their ride sharing data public, we ventured to examine their data to better understand and explain to potential investors how we would be able to  replicate this model.
