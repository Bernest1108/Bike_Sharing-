# Bike_Sharing
## Overview
While on vacation in New York City using the Citi Bike network to move around the city, the idea came to us to bring a similar business venture to Des Moines, Iowa. Because Citi Bike makes their ride sharing data public, we ventured to examine their data to better understand and explain to potential investors how we would be able to  replicate this model.

## Results
The data throughout the month of August 2019, a couple of trends became clear.
As far as demographics of the customer base go, most of the customer base consists of regular subscribers, with 81% of the total customer base being subscribers.

As you can see the customer base leans towards male:

Assumptions have been made about how the customer base uses the service, firstly that it would primarily used by tourists as a way to move around the city, while still being able to see it. If this would be the case, you most likely would see an up-tick of rides around tourist destinations and more skewed towards weekends or distributed throughout the week. This is not is what is being seen in the data. First, the distribution of what hour of the day that bikes were checked out show a concentration towards weekday rush hours.
